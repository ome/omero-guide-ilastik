=======

ilastik is a free open-source interactive learning and segmentation toolkit, with which can be used to leverage machine learning algorithms to easily segment, classify, track and count cells or other experimental data. For more details go to see \ https://www.ilastik.org/\.
We will show how to analyze data stored in OMERO, using the ilastik user interface, Fiji and the OMERO ImageJ plugin. We will then also show how to analyze using the ilastik API and OMERO.py API.
